Third question assigned from category B:
B14. Access a web page your of your school (plus two or PU) and analyze the total number of requests made by the browser for that web page. Out of these total HTTP Requests, count the number of those requests that correspond to image and their total size.

Details of Work done:
-->To analyze the total number of http requests made by the browser for a web page we have used "Developer tools"  that is built directly into the google chrome web browser. 
-->The web page that chosen: "http://www.christjuniorcollege.in/ ".

How it is done ?
-->First open the web page in the the chrome browser.Then go to the settings option provided in chrome.Under more tools,select developer tools.Alternatively,you can also use the shorcut keys:"ctrl+shift+I".
-->In developper tools,select the network panel.Initially it will be empty and shows you a prompt that says :"Recording network activity.. perform a request or hit ctrl+R to record the reload.That's because DevTools only logs network activity while it's open.
-->Now,you need to reload the webpage and the panel starts recording the activity that takes place between the browser and the webpage.
-->Analyse the information displayed.
